    <div> Born and raised in Texas. I graduated from UT Arlington with a B.S. in Biology/Chemistry.
	As well as working in many labs, I have also enjoyed working at an animal hospital for 5 years. I have a variety of hobbies and with them the desire to learn.
	I look forward to my next step in learning to code and with it new opportunities.
